    /// distances between points and is accessed like a 2-Dimensional rectangular.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// We calculate all possible unique pair-wise distances
    /// between the points to avoid any further distance calculations.
    /// There is a one-to-one correspondence between uniquePairs and uniqueDistances
    /// The uniqueDistance array holds the calculated distances between pairs of objects.
    /// As an example, consider the distance matrix below created by a list of 4 entries.
    /// The top and left columns are an item's index in entry list. So the Point at (2,1)
    /// would be the distance between the 3rd and 2nd item in the index list.

    /// | - 0 1 2 3 |
    /// | 0 X 5 4 3 |
    /// | 1 X X 2 1 |
    /// | 2 X X X 0 |
    /// | 3 X X X X |
    ///
    /// All entries in the matrix with X are duplicate or self-distances (which are always 0).
    /// The non X entries represent the index in the uniqueDistances array in which the distance is stored.
    ///
    /// Calculating the index for the given pair(p, q):
    /// Note that dist(p, q) = dist(q, p).
    /// The number of valid entries in each row always increases by 1 as we move up. Also, the
    /// bottom row is always empty. Thus we use the formula for calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    ///
    /// The largest index of the row containing (p, q) is
    ///             var x = (Entries.Length - 1) - Min(p, q);
    ///             var largestIndex = x(x + 1) / 2;

    /// To locate the index of the Point(p, q) we now just subtract the offset of how many positions
    /// in the current row (p, q) is from largestIndex.
