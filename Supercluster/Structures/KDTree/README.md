# Supercluster.KDTree
This is a [KD-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) written completely in C#.  This project originally 
started as a fork of the KD-Tree Written by [CodeandCats](https://github.com/codeandcats), however, the 
structure and intention of this project has changed drastically from its origin. 

## About the Project

This is a KD-Tree that is optimized for machine learning applications, **however, it can used for less intensive purposes as well**. (In fact, I am writing this for my machine learning library [Supercluster](https://github.com/MathFerret1013/Supercluster)) In machine learning data-sets
 are often built, re-built, and built again
